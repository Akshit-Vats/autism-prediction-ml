# autism-prediction-ml

This project predicts the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on behavioral and demographic data using machine learning techniques.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Data preprocessing & cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Training multiple ML models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall & F1-score  
- Final autism prediction model  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains features such as:  
- Age, gender, family history  
- Behavioral screening test scores  
- Yes/No answers to key diagnostic questions

The dataset is included in the `data/` folder for easy access.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, Imbalanced-Learn (SMOTE),)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Model Performance  
- Accuracy: XX%  
- Precision: XX%  
- Recall: XX%
