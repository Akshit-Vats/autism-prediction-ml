# autism-prediction-ml

This project predicts the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on behavioral and demographic data using machine learning techniques.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Data preprocessing & cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Training multiple ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall & F1-score  
- Final autism prediction model  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains features such as:  
- Age, gender, family history  
- Behavioral screening test scores  
- Yes/No answers to key diagnostic questions  

*(You can add dataset source if public)*  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
